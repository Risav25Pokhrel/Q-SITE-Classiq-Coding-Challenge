    "Welcome to the Swap Test Challenge! Your task is to implement the Swap Test algorithm, a fundamental quantum procedure for comparing quantum states. Using Classiqâ€™s quantum programming framework, you will construct a quantum circuit that measures the overlap between two quantum states, allowing you to determine their similarity with high precision. Your goal is to understand and apply the principles of the Swap Test to extract meaningful results from quantum computations.\n",

    "In this challenge, you will implement and explore the Swap Test algorithm using Classiq's quantum programming framework. The Swap Test is a quantum algorithm used to determine the overlap between two quantum states. This challenge will guide you through constructing a quantum circuit that uses the Swap Test to compare two random quantum states, measure their overlap, and validate the results.\n",

    "### **Understanding the Swap Test**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Swap Test is a quantum function that checks the overlap between two quantum states. The inputs of the function are two quantum registers of the same size, $|\\psi_1\\rangle$ and $|\\psi_2\\rangle$, and it returns as an output a single \"test\" qubit whose state encodes the overlap between the two inputs:\n",

    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\alpha^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 1 + |\\langle\\psi_1|\\psi_2\\rangle|^2 \\right).\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the probability of measuring the test qubit in the state $|0\\rangle$ is 1 if the states are identical (up to a global phase) and 0.5 if the states are orthogonal to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantum model for the Swap Test starts with an H gate on the test qubit, followed by swapping between the two states controlled on the test qubit (a controlled-SWAP gate for each of the qubits in the two states), and a final H gate on the test qubit.\n"
