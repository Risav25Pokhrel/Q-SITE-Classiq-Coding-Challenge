    "### **Phase Kickback in Quantum Computing**\n",
    "hase kickback is a fundamental and widely used primitive in quantum computing. It is a process where the result of a function is transferred to the phase of a quantum state. This transfer is crucial because it allows the phase to be manipulated using constructive and destructive interference, leading to the desired computational outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "In quantum computing, algorithms are generally structured into three key steps:\n",
    "1. **Encoding the Data:** Preparing the quantum states with the necessary information.\n",
    "2. **Manipulating the Data:** Applying quantum operations that process the encoded information.\n",
    "3. **Extracting the Result:** Measuring the quantum states to obtain the final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phase kickback plays a critical role in the manipulation stage, enabling the accurate extraction of results by influencing the phase of quantum states.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How Does Phase Kickback Work?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard way to apply a classical function $f : \\{0, 1\\}^n \\rightarrow \\{0, 1\\}$ on quantum states is by using the oracle model. In this model, the oracle $O_f$ acts on quantum states $|x\\rangle$ and $|y\\rangle$ as follows:\n",
    "$\n",
    "O_f(|x\\rangle|y\\rangle) = |x\\rangle|y \\oplus f(x)\\rangle\n",
    "$\n",
    "Here, $|x\\rangle$ and $|y\\rangle$ are the argument and target quantum states, respectively, and $\\oplus$ represents addition modulo 2 or the XOR operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The phase kickback primitive takes this oracle $O_f$ as input and performs the operation:\n",
    "$\n",
    "|x\\rangle \\rightarrow (-1)^{f(x)}|x\\rangle\n",
    "$\n",
    "This operation can be applied to a superposition of states:\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\sum_{i=0}^{2^n-1} \\alpha_i |x_i\\rangle \\rightarrow \\sum_{i=0}^{2^n-1} (-1)^{f(x_i)} \\alpha_i |x_i\\rangle\n",
    "$\n",
    "where $\\alpha_i$ is the amplitude of the state $|x_i\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why is Phase Kickback Important?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The beauty of phase kickback lies in its simplicity. By applying the oracle $O_f$ to the target quantum state $|-\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (|0\\rangle - |1\\rangle)$, we get:\n",
    "$\n",
    "O_f(|x\\rangle|-\\rangle) = (-1)^{f(x)}|x\\rangle|-\\rangle\n",
    "$\n",
    "This effectively achieves the desired transformation:\n",
    "$\n",
    "|x\\rangle \\rightarrow (-1)^{f(x)}|x\\rangle\n",
    "$\n",
    "Through this mechanism, the phase of the quantum state $|x\\rangle$ is modified based on the function $f(x)$, which is essential in many quantum algorithms such as the Deutsch-Jozsa and Simon's algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Challenge Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, you will implement phase kickback using Classiq's quantum programming framework. You'll construct a quantum circuit that leverages phase kickback to manipulate quantum states, applying the principles described above. This exercise will help you understand the power of phase manipulation in quantum computing and its applications in various quantum algorithms.\n",
